# (Re-)learning Object Oriented Design patterns

Hello, my name is Gueorgui and I have a lot to learn.

In this repo, I'm planning to go through every pattern on [OODesign.com](https://www.oodesign.com/), and implement it in Ruby and in JavaScript. (I might add other languages later!)

In case you're interested, [here's a board of other learning material I'm planning to study](https://www.are.na/gueorgui-tcherednitchenko/engineering-refresh).
